cosmo-sdl-template - Minimal SDL2 sample for Cosmopolitan

The binary you see checked in, cosmo-sdl.com, should run without modification on:
Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD.
If it doesn't, do let me know so I can fix it.

Q: Cosmopolitan?
A: https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan

Q: Where are the rest of the SDL functions?
A: TODO. This is still a WIP

Build dependencies: cosmocc
Runtime dependencies: SDL2 installed on a cosmo supported OS.

To build: make
To run: ./cosmo-sdl.com
